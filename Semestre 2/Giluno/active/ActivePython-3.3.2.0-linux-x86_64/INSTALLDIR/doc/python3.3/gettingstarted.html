<h1>Getting Started with ActivePython 3.3</h1>

<p>Welcome to ActivePython!  Python is an interpreted
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.activestate.com/white-papers/benefits-dynamic-languages"
>dynamic
programming language <img src="img/xlink.gif" border="0"/></a>. ActivePython is
a binary distribution of that language: a no-hassle, ready to install package
to lets you get to the business of writing Python software.</p>

<p>Presumably you have now installed ActivePython. (If not, head over to the
<a href="installnotes.html">Install Notes</a> to find out how.) <em>So now
what?</em> This page will help you get started using ActivePython
3.3 quickly and effectively.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you are an old Python hat but just new to ActivePython, the 
<a href="welcome.html">User Guide welcome page</a> gives a brief answer to
<q><em>What is ActivePython?</em></q> and <a href="whatsincluded.html">this
page</a> describes the contents of the ActivePython distribution.
</li>

<li>If you are new to Python you might want to read any or all of the 
<a href="python/tutorial/index.html">Python Tutorial</a>, the 
<a href="easytut/index.html">Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python</a>, and
<a href="diveintopython/html/toc/index.html">Dive Into Python</a> depending on
your programming experience. After having read those the 
<a href="python/index.html">main Python documentation</a>, 
especially the <a href="python/library/index.html">Library Reference</a>, will most
likely be your best reference.</li>

<li>If you are upgrading your Python version to 3.3, you
should read <a href="python/whatsnew/3.3.html">What's New in
Python 3.3?</a> For a more detailed change list, check out the
<a href="whatsnew/NEWS.html">Python NEWS file</a>.</li>

<h3>Running Python and the Interactive Shell</h3>
<p>The ActivePython installer on Windows will automatically add
<code>python</code> to your PATH environment variable (Win98/WinME users may
have to reboot for this change to take effect) so you should be able to run
<code>python</code> at the DOS shell to start the Python interactive shell. You
can also start the Python interactive shell from the ActivePython program group
under the Windows Start menu. You should see something like the following:</p>

<pre>ActivePython 3.3.2.0 (ActiveState Software Inc.) based on
Python 3.3.2 (#65, Mar 30 2005, 09:33:37 [MSC v.1310 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

<p>You can use the Python shell to interactively run Python code. This can be
very useful development and debugging tool. Learn how to use Python's built-in
<a href="python/library/functions.html#dir"><code>dir()</code></a> and 
<a href="python/library/functions.html#help"><code>help()</code></a>
introspection functions to dive into Python objects. For example, try running
the following:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; import os.path
&gt;&gt;&gt; dir(os.path)
<strong>list of members of os.path module...</strong>
&gt;&gt;&gt; help(os.path)
<strong>MAN page-like description of the os.path module...</strong>
&gt;&gt;&gt; help(os.path.join)
<strong>help on the join function...</strong>
</pre>

<h3>GUI Programming</h3>

<p><a href="python/library/tk.html">Tkinter</a> is Python's binding to
the cross-platform Tk GUI toolkit and is a default part of any ActivePython
installation.</p>

<p>wxPython is another popular cross-platform GUI programming toolkit. It is
available separately from <a
href="http://www.wxpython.org/">http://www.wxpython.org/</a>.</p>

<p>Python includes a large number of GUI programming toolkits and while Tkinter
and wxPython are the primary two contenders on Windows, there are some other
options. The included PyWin32 extensions provide some bindings to Windows UI
routines (<a href="pywin32/win32ui.html">win32ui</a>,
<a href="pywin32/win32uiole.html">win32uiole</a>). As well there are the 
<a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro">PyQT</a>
and <a href="http://www.pygtk.org/">PyGTK</a> bindings to the QT and GTK GUI
toolkits, respectively. They are both available separately. Both QT's and GTK's
main roots are in the Linux/Unix platform, but they are available for Windows
as well.</p>

<h3>Windows-specific Libraries and Tools</h3>

<p>ActivePython on Windows includes the
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/">PyWin32 extensions</a>.
These extensions provide bindings to much of the Windows API, full Windows COM
integration, and the Pythonwin IDE (a basic Python editing environment). Read
more about the Windows API and COM integration in the
<a href="pywin32/PyWin32.HTML">PyWin32 documentation</a> (only include in the
ActivePython documentation on Windows).</p>

<h3>Running Python and the Interactive Shell</h3>
<p>The ActivePython installer on Mac OS X installs symlinks for running
<code>python</code>, <code>pythonw</code>, and <code>pydoc</code> to
<code>/usr/local/bin</code>. If this directory is not already on your PATH you
can add it manually as follows. Note that the default setup on Mac OS X 
10.4 (Tiger) does <em>not</em> put <code>/usr/local/bin</code> on
your PATH.</p>

<pre># Place the following in your <code>~/.bashrc</code> file.
PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH; export PATH
</pre>

<p>Open the Terminal application
(<code>/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app</code>) and type <code>python</code>.
(If you already had a terminal open you may need to start a new one to see the
PATH changes.) You should see something like the following:</p>

<pre>ActivePython 3.3.2.0 (ActiveState Software Inc.) based on
Python 3.3.2 (#1, Mar 30 2005, 09:33:37)

</pre>

<p>Read the <a href="python/tutorial/index.html">Python Tutorial</a> for more information.</p>

<h5>pythonw</h5>

On Mac OS X, any process that provides a GUI (i.e. talks to the Aqua window
manager) needs to be launched in a certain way. The <code>pythonw</code>
command (just a stub that calls the actual Python executable as required) is
provided for this purpose. If your Python code provides a GUI, launch it with
<code>pythonw</code> instead of <code>python</code>. (There <em>is</em> a <a
href="http://svn.red-bean.com/pyobjc/trunk/pyobjc/pyobjc-core/Examples/Scripts/wmEnable.py">hack</a>,
but it is not recommended.)


<h3>GUI Programming</h3>

<p><a href="python/library/tk.html">Tkinter</a> is Python's binding to
the cross-platform Tk GUI toolkit. ActivePython includes Tkinter by default,
but on Mac OS X you must also install
<a href="http://www.activestate.com/activetcl">ActiveTcl</a> 
to use Tkinter.</p>

<p>wxPython is another popular cross-platform GUI programming toolkit. It is
available separately from <a
href="http://www.wxpython.org/">http://www.wxpython.org/</a>.</p>

<p>The PyObjC project provides a bridge between Python and Apple's Objective-C
system. Part of this system is the Cocao toolkit for Mac OS X GUI programming.
See below for more information.</p>

<h3>Mac OS X-specific Libraries and Tools</h3>

<h5>Documentation</h5>
<p>In addition to the <a href="python/library/index.html">Python Library
Reference</a> that most Python developers will want to be familiar with, Python
developers on Mac OS X may also want to take a look at the 
<a href="python/library/mac.html">Macintosh Module Reference</a>. Please be aware,
however, that some of this documentation is out-of-date (some of referring to
Mac OS 9, a.k.a. Mac Classic). The most useful sections will be
<a href="python/library/carbon.html">MacOS Toolbox Modules</a> and possibly
<a href="python/library/macosa.html#mac-scripting">MacPython OSA Modules</a>, which discusses
current bindings to Apple's OSA (Open Scripting Architecture, of which
AppleScript is an implementation) system.</p>

<h5>PyObjC</h5>
<p>The <a href="http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/">PyObjC project</a>, as mentioned
above, provides a bridge between Python and Apple's Objective-C system. In
particular it provides the ability to write complete Mac OS X GUI applications
in Python. PyObjC is, at the time of this writing, being very actively
developed. You can either install the latest release version of PyObjC using 
<a href="pypm.html#installing-packages">PyPM</a> or build it yourself 
as follows:
</p>

<ol>
<li>If you do not have a <code>/Developer</code> directory, you will first need
to install the Apple Developer Tools. These are often available on a separate
CD that shipped with your Mac hardware. Alternatively you can 
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/">download them</a> from Apple's
developer site after registering for a (free) ADC membership.</li>

<li>You will need a Subversion client, <code>svn</code>, with which to checkout
the latest PyObjC sources. You can find a Subversion installer 
<a href="http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html#osx">here</a>.</li>

<li>Run the following to download, build, and install PyObjC:
<pre>svn co http://svn.red-bean.com/pyobjc/trunk/pyobjc/
cd pyobjc
/usr/local/bin/python setup.py install
</pre></li>
</ol>

<h5>py2app</h5>
<p><code>py2app</code> (available separately from 
<a href="http://undefined.org/python/py2app.html">here</a>) is an
extension to <a href="python/distutils/index.html">Python's standard distutils
system</a> for building and distributing Python software. If would like to
distribute your Python software as full-fledged Mac OS X applications and/or
with Mac OS X Installer packages you should take a look at <code>py2app</code>.
