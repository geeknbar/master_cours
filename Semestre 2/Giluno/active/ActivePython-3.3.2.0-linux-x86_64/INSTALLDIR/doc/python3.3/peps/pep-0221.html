<h3>Introduction</h3>
<pre>
    This PEP describes the `import as' proposal for Python 2.0.  This
    PEP tracks the status and ownership of this feature.  It contains
    a description of the feature and outlines changes necessary to
    support the feature.  The CVS revision history of this file
    contains the definitive historical record.


</pre>
<h3>Rationale</h3>
<pre>
    This PEP proposes an extention of Python syntax regarding the
    `import' and `from &lt;module&gt; import' statements.  These statements
    load in a module, and either bind that module to a local name, or
    binds objects from that module to a local name.  However, it is
    sometimes desirable to bind those objects to a different name, for
    instance to avoid name clashes.  This can currently be achieved
    using the following idiom:

        import os
        real_os = os
        del os
    
    And similarly for the `from ... import' statement:
    
        from os import fdopen, exit, stat
        os_fdopen = fdopen
        os_stat = stat
        del fdopen, stat
    
    The proposed syntax change would add an optional `as' clause to
    both these statements, as follows:

        import os as real_os
        from os import fdopen as os_fdopen, exit, stat as os_stat
    
    The `as' name is not intended to be a keyword, and some trickery
    has to be used to convince the CPython parser it isn't one.  For
    more advanced parsers/tokenizers, however, this should not be a
    problem.

    A slightly special case exists for importing sub-modules.  The
    statement

        import os.path    

    stores the module `os' locally as `os', so that the imported
    submodule `path' is accessible as `os.path'.  As a result,
    
        import os.path as p

    stores `os.path', not `os', in `p'.  This makes it effectively the
    same as
    
        from os import path as p


</pre>
<h3>Implementation details</h3>
<pre>
    This PEP has been accepted, and the suggested code change has been
    checked in.  The patch can still be found in the SourceForge patch
    manager[1].  Currently, a NAME field is used in the grammar rather
    than a bare string, to avoid the keyword issue.  It introduces a
    new bytecode, IMPORT_STAR, which performs the `from module import
    *' behaviour, and changes the behaviour of the IMPORT_FROM
    bytecode so that it loads the requested name (which is always a
    single name) onto the stack, to be subsequently stored by a STORE
    opcode. As a result, all names explicitly imported now follow the
    `global' directives.

    The special case of `from module import *' remains a special case,
    in that it cannot accomodate an `as' clause, and that no STORE
    opcodes are generated; the objects imported are loaded directly
    into the local namespace. This also means that names imported in
    this fashion are always local, and do not follow the `global'
    directive.
    
    An additional change to this syntax has also been suggested, to
    generalize the expression given after the `as' clause.  Rather
    than a single name, it could be allowed to be any expression that
    yields a valid l-value; anything that can be assigned to.  The
    change to accomodate this is minimal, as the patch[2] proves, and
    the resulting generalization allows a number of new constructs
    that run completely parallel with other Python assignment
    constructs. However, this idea has been rejected by Guido, as
    `hypergeneralization'.
