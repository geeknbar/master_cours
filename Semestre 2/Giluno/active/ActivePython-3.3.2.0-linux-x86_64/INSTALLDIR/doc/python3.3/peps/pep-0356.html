<h3>Abstract</h3>
<pre>
    This document describes the development and release schedule for
    Python 2.5.  The schedule primarily concerns itself with PEP-sized

    beta release.  Bugs may be fixed until the final release.

    There will be at least two alpha releases, two beta releases, and
    one release candidate.  The release date is planned for 
    12 September 2006.

        <a href="http://python.org/sf/1544279">http://python.org/sf/1544279</a> - Socket module is not thread-safe
        <a href="http://python.org/sf/1541420">http://python.org/sf/1541420</a> - tools and demo missing from windows
        <a href="http://python.org/sf/1542451">http://python.org/sf/1542451</a> - crash with continue in nested try/finally
        <a href="http://python.org/sf/1475523">http://python.org/sf/1475523</a> - gettext.py bug (owner: Martin v. Loewis)
