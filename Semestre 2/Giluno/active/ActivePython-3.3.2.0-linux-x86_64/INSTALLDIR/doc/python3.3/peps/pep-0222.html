<h3>Abstract</h3>
<pre>
    This PEP proposes a set of enhancements to the CGI development
    facilities in the Python standard library.  Enhancements might be
    new features, new modules for tasks such as cookie support, or
    removal of obsolete code.

    The original intent was to make improvements to Python 2.1.
    However, there seemed little interest from the Python community,
    and time was lacking, so this PEP has been deferred to some future
    Python release.
    

</pre>
<h3>Open Issues</h3>
<pre>
    This section lists changes that have been suggested, but about
    which no firm decision has yet been made.  In the final version of
    this PEP, this section should be empty, as all the changes should
    be classified as accepted or rejected.

    cgi.py: We should not be told to create our own subclass just so
    we can handle file uploads. As a practical matter, I have yet to
    find the time to do this right, so I end up reading cgi.py's temp
    file into, at best, another file. Some of our legacy code actually
    reads it into a second temp file, then into a final destination!
    And even if we did, that would mean creating yet another object
    with its __init__ call and associated overhead.

    cgi.py: Currently, query data with no `=' are ignored.  Even if
    keep_blank_values is set, queries like `...?value=&amp;...' are
    returned with blank values but queries like `...?value&amp;...' are
    completely lost.  It would be great if such data were made
    available through the FieldStorage interface, either as entries
    with None as values, or in a separate list.

    Utility function: build a query string from a list of 2-tuples

    Dictionary-related utility classes: NoKeyErrors (returns an empty
    string, never a KeyError), PartialStringSubstitution (returns 
    the original key string, never a KeyError)


    
</pre>
<h3>New Modules</h3>
<pre>
    This section lists details about entire new packages or modules
    that should be added to the Python standard library.

    * fcgi.py : A new module adding support for the FastCGI protocol.
      Robin Dunn's code needs to be ported to Windows, though.

</pre>
<h3>Major Changes to Existing Modules</h3>
<pre>
    This section lists details of major changes to existing modules,
    whether in implementation or in interface.  The changes in this
    section therefore carry greater degrees of risk, either in
    introducing bugs or a backward incompatibility.

    The cgi.py module would be deprecated.  (XXX A new module or
    package name hasn't been chosen yet: 'web'?  'cgilib'?)

</pre>
<h3>Minor Changes to Existing Modules</h3>
<pre>
    This section lists details of minor changes to existing modules.
    These changes should have relatively small implementations, and
    have little risk of introducing incompatibilities with previous
    versions.


</pre>
<h3>Rejected Changes</h3>
<pre>
    The changes listed in this section were proposed for Python 2.1,
    but were rejected as unsuitable.  For each rejected change, a
    rationale is given describing why the change was deemed
    inappropriate.

    * An HTML generation module is not part of this PEP.  Several such
      modules exist, ranging from HTMLgen's purely programming
      interface to ASP-inspired simple templating to DTML's complex
      templating.  There's no indication of which templating module to
      enshrine in the standard library, and that probably means that
      no module should be so chosen.

    * cgi.py: Allowing a combination of query data and POST data.
      This doesn't seem to be standard at all, and therefore is
      dubious practice.

</pre>
<h3>Proposed Interface</h3>
<pre>
    XXX open issues: naming convention (studlycaps or
    underline-separated?); need to look at the cgi.parse*() functions
    and see if they can be simplified, too.

    Parsing functions: carry over most of the parse* functions from
    cgi.py
