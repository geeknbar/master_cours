<H1><A NAME="SECTION001010000000000000000">
Variables with more than one value</A>
</H1>
You have already seen ordinary variables that store a single value.  However other variable types can hold more than one value.  The simplest type is called a list.  Here is a example of a list being used:

<P>
<PRE>
which_one = input("What month (1-12)? ")
months = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July',\
        'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December']
if 1 &lt;= which_one &lt;= 12:
        print "The month is",months[which_one - 1]
</PRE>

<P>
and a output example:
<PRE>
What month (1-12)? 3
The month is March
</PRE>

<P>
In this example the <TT>months</TT> is a list.  <TT>months</TT> is defined with the lines <TT>months = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July',<code>\</code> 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December']</TT>  (Note that a <code>\</code> can be used to split a long line).  The <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> start and end the list with comma's (``<code>,</code>'') separating the list items.  The list is used in <code>months[which_one - 1]</code>.  A list consists of items that are numbered starting at 0.  In other words if you wanted January you would use <TT>months[0]</TT>.  Give a list a number and it will return the value that is stored at that location.  

<P>
The statement <TT>if 1 &lt;= which_one &lt;= 12:</TT> will only be true if <TT>which_one</TT> is between one and twelve inclusive (in other words it is what you would expect if you have seen that in algebra).

<P>
Lists can be thought of as a series of boxes. For example, the boxes created by  <TT>demolist = ['life',42, 'the universe', 6,'and',7]</TT> would look like this:

<P>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=3 BORDER="1">
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">box number</TD>
<TD ALIGN="CENTER">0</TD>
<TD ALIGN="CENTER">1</TD>
<TD ALIGN="CENTER">2</TD>
<TD ALIGN="CENTER">3</TD>
<TD ALIGN="CENTER">4</TD>
<TD ALIGN="CENTER">5</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">demolist</TD>
<TD ALIGN="CENTER">`life'</TD>
<TD ALIGN="CENTER">42</TD>
<TD ALIGN="CENTER">`the universe'</TD>
<TD ALIGN="CENTER">6</TD>
<TD ALIGN="CENTER">`and'</TD>
<TD ALIGN="CENTER">7</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
Each box is referenced by its number so the statement <TT>demolist[0]</TT> would get <TT>'life'</TT>, <TT>demolist[1]</TT> would get <TT>42</TT> and so on up to <TT>demolist[5]</TT> getting <TT>7</TT>.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION001020000000000000000">
More features of lists</A>
</H1>
The next example is just to show a lot of other stuff lists can do (for once I don't expect you to type it in, but you should probably play around with lists until you are comfortable with them.).  Here goes:
<PRE>
demolist = ['life',42, 'the universe', 6,'and',7]
print 'demolist = ',demolist
demolist.append('everything')
print "after 'everything' was appended demolist is now:"
print demolist
print 'len(demolist) =', len(demolist)
print 'demolist.index(42) =',demolist.index(42)
print 'demolist[1] =', demolist[1]
#Next we will loop through the list
c = 0
while c &lt; len(demolist):
    print 'demolist[',c,']=',demolist[c]
    c = c + 1
del demolist[2]
print "After 'the universe' was removed demolist is now:"
print demolist
if 'life' in demolist:
    print "'life' was found in demolist"
else:
    print "'life' was not found in demolist"
if 'amoeba' in demolist:
    print "'amoeba' was found in demolist"
if 'amoeba' not in demolist:
    print "'amoeba' was not found in demolist"
demolist.sort()
print 'The sorted demolist is ',demolist
</PRE>

<P>
The output is:
<PRE>
demolist =  ['life', 42, 'the universe', 6, 'and', 7]
after 'everything' was appended demolist is now:
['life', 42, 'the universe', 6, 'and', 7, 'everything']
len(demolist) = 7
demolist.index(42) = 1
demolist[1] = 42
demolist[ 0 ]= life
demolist[ 1 ]= 42
demolist[ 2 ]= the universe
demolist[ 3 ]= 6
demolist[ 4 ]= and
demolist[ 5 ]= 7
demolist[ 6 ]= everything
After 'the universe' was removed demolist is now:
['life', 42, 6, 'and', 7, 'everything']
'life' was found in demolist
'amoeba' was not found in demolist
The sorted demolist is  [6, 7, 42, 'and', 'everything', 'life']
</PRE>

<P>
This example uses a whole bunch of new functions.  Notice that you can
just <TT>print</TT> a whole list.  Next the <TT>append</TT> function is used
to add a new item to the end of the list.  <code>len</code> returns how many
items are in a list.  The valid indexes (as in numbers that can be
used inside of the []) of a list range from 0 to <TT>len - 1</TT>. The
<TT>index</TT> function tell where the first location of an item is
located in a list.  Notice how <code>demolist.index(42)</code> returns 1 and
when <code>demolist[1]</code> is run it returns 42.  The line
<code>#Next we will loop through the list</code> is a just a reminder to the
programmer (also called a comment).  Python will ignore any lines that
start with a <code>#</code>.  Next the lines:
<PRE>
c = 0
while c &lt; len(demolist):
    print 'demolist[',c,']=',demolist[c]
    c = c + 1
</PRE> 
Create a variable <TT>c</TT> which starts at 0 and is incremented until it reaches the last index of the list.  Meanwhile the <TT>print</TT> statement prints out each element of the list.  

<P>
The <code>del</code> command can be used to remove a given element in a list.  The next few lines use the <TT>in</TT> operator to test if a element is in or is not in a list.  

<P>
The <code>sort</code> function sorts the list.  This is useful if you need a
list in order from smallest number to largest or alphabetical.  Note
that this rearranges the list.

<P>
In summary for a list the following operations occur:

<P>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=3 BORDER="1">
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">example</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">explanation</TD>

<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT"><TT>list[2]</TT></TD>

</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT"><TT>list.append("value")</TT></TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">adds an element <TT>"value"</TT> at the end of the list</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
This next example uses these features in a more useful way:
<PRE>
menu_item = 0
list = []
while menu_item != 9:
        print "--------------------"
        print "1. Print the list"
        print "2. Add a name to the list"
        print "3. Remove a name from the list"
        print "4. Change an item in the list"
        print "9. Quit"
        menu_item = input("Pick an item from the menu: ")
        if menu_item == 1:
                current = 0
                if len(list) &gt; 0:
                        while current &lt; len(list):
                                print current,". ",list[current]
                                current = current + 1
                else:
                        print "List is empty"
        elif menu_item == 2:
                name = raw_input("Type in a name to add: ")
                list.append(name)
        elif menu_item == 3:
                del_name = raw_input("What name would you like to remove: ")
                if del_name in list:
                        item_number = list.index(del_name)
                        del list[item_number]
                        #The code above only removes the first occurance of
                        # the name.  The code below from Gerald removes all.
                        #while del_name in list:
                        #       item_number = list.index(del_name)
                        #       del list[item_number]
                else:
                        print del_name," was not found"
        elif menu_item == 4:
                old_name = raw_input("What name would you like to change: ")
                if old_name in list:
                        item_number = list.index(old_name)
                        new_name = raw_input("What is the new name: ")
                        list[item_number] = new_name
                else:
                        print old_name," was not found"
print "Goodbye"
</PRE>

<P>
And here is part of the output:

<P>
<PRE>
--------------------
1. Print the list
2. Add a name to the list
3. Remove a name from the list
4. Change an item in the list
9. Quit

Pick an item from the menu: 2
Type in a name to add: Jack

Pick an item from the menu: 2
Type in a name to add: Jill

Pick an item from the menu: 1
0 .  Jack
1 .  Jill

Pick an item from the menu: 3
What name would you like to remove: Jack

Pick an item from the menu: 4
What name would you like to change: Jill
What is the new name: Jill Peters

Pick an item from the menu: 1
0 .  Jill Peters

Pick an item from the menu: 9
Goodbye
</PRE>

<P>
That was a long program.  Let's take a look at the source code.   The line <TT>list = []</TT> makes the variable <TT>list</TT> a list with no items (or elements).  The next important line is <code>while menu_item != 9:</code>.  This line starts a loop that allows the menu system for this program.  The next few lines display a menu and decide which part of the program to run.  

<P>
The section:
<PRE>
current = 0
if len(list) &gt; 0:
        while current &lt; len(list):
                print current,". ",list[current]
                current = current + 1
else:
        print "List is empty"
</PRE>
goes through the list and prints each name.  <code>len(list_name)</code> tell how many items are in a list.  If <TT>len</TT> returns <code>0</code> then the list is empty.

<P>
Then a few lines later the statement <TT>list.append(name)</TT> appears.  It uses the <TT>append</TT> function to add a item to the end of the list.  Jump down another two lines and notice this section of code:
<PRE>
item_number = list.index(del_name)
del list[item_number]
</PRE>
Here the <TT>index</TT> function is used to find the index value that will be used later to remove the item.  <code>del list[item_number]</code> is used to remove a element of the list.   

<P>
The next section
<PRE>
old_name = raw_input("What name would you like to change: ")
if old_name in list:
        item_number = list.index(old_name)
        new_name = raw_input("What is the new name: ")
        list[item_number] = new_name
else:
        print old_name," was not found"
</PRE>
uses <TT>index</TT> to find the <code>item_number</code> and then puts <code>new_name</code> where the <code>old_name</code> was.  

<P>
Congraduations, with lists under your belt, you now know enough of the language
that you could do any computations that a computer can do (this is technically known as Turing-Completness).  Of course, there are still many features that
are used to make your life easier.

Expand the test.py program so it has menu giving the option of taking
