BufferedWriter and BufferedRandom.</li>
<li>Issue #7963: Fixed misleading error message that issued when object is
called without arguments.</li>
<li>Issue #5308: Raise ValueError when marshalling too large object (a sequence
with size &gt;= 2**31), instead of producing illegal marshal data.</li>
<li>Issue #12983: Bytes literals with invalid x escape now raise a SyntaxError
and a full traceback including line number.</li>

bootstrapping of importlib.</li>

are now initialized dynamically as needed.</li>
<li>Issue #16980: Fix processing of escaped non-ascii bytes in the
unicode-escape-decode decoder.</li>

in any mapping, not only in a string.</li>
<li>Issue #16730: importlib.machinery.FileFinder now no longers raises an
exception when trying to populate its cache and it finds out the directory is
unreadable or has turned into a file. Reported and diagnosed by
David Pritchard.</li>

cleared.</li>
<li>Issue #11461: Fix the incremental UTF-16 decoder. Original patch by

<li>Issue #16455: On FreeBSD and Solaris, if the locale is C, the
ASCII/surrogateescape codec is now used, instead of the locale encoding, to
decode the command line arguments. This change fixes inconsistencies with
os.fsencode() and os.fsdecode() because these operating systems announces an
ASCII locale encoding, whereas the ISO-8859-1 encoding is used in practice.</li>

chain, the object could remain reachable through its weakref even though
its refcount had dropped to zero.</li>
<li>Issue #16416: On Mac OS X, operating system data are now always
encoded/decoded to/from UTF-8/surrogateescape, instead of the locale encoding
(which may be ASCII if no locale environment variable is set), to avoid
inconsistencies with os.fsencode() and os.fsdecode() functions which are
already using UTF-8/surrogateescape.</li>
<li>Issue #16588: Silence unused-but-set warnings in Python/thread_pthread</li>
<li>Issue #16546: Fix: ast.YieldFrom argument is now mandatory.</li>

(actually, any non-string or non-bytes type).</li>
<li>Issue #16306: Fix multiple error messages when unknown command line
parameters where passed to the interpreter.  Patch by Hieu Nguyen.</li>

Patch by Serhiy Storchaka.</li>
<li>Issue #8401: assigning an int to a bytearray slice (e.g. b[3:4] = 5) now
raises an error.</li>
<li>Fix segfaults on setting __qualname__ on builtin types and attempting to
delete it on any type.</li>
<li>Issue #16345: Fix an infinite loop when <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fromkeys</span></tt> on a dict subclass
received a nonempty dict from the constructor.</li>
<li>Issue #16271: Fix strange bugs that resulted from __qualname__ appearing in a
class's __dict__ and on type.</li>
<li>Issue #6074: Ensure cached bytecode files can always be updated by the
user that created them, even when the source file is read-only.</li>

range(), and slice() to use multi-line signatures.</li>
<li>Issue #16160: Subclass support now works for types.SimpleNamespace.</li>
<li>Issue #15379: Fix passing of non-BMP characters as integers for the charmap
decoder (already working as unicode strings).  Patch by Serhiy Storchaka.</li>
<li>Issue #15144: Fix possible integer overflow when handling pointers as integer
values, by using <cite>Py_uintptr_t</cite> instead of <cite>size_t</cite>.  Patch by Serhiy

64-bit/32-bit Pythons.  If the user does not explicitly override
the default C compiler by setting the CC environment variable,
Distutils will now attempt to compile extension modules with clang
if gcc-4.2 is required but not found. Also as a convenience, if
the user does explicitly set CC, substitute its value as the default
compiler in the Distutils LDSHARED configuration variable for OS X.
(Note, the python.org 32-bit-only Pythons use gcc-4.0 and the 10.4u

<li>Issue #10968: Remove indirection in threading.  The public names (Event,
Condition, etc.) used to be factory functions returning instances of hidden
classes (_Event, _Condition, etc.), because (if Guido recalls correctly) this
code pre-dates the ability to subclass extension types.  It is now possible

Jacek Konieczny.</li>

functions, allowing for round tripping of RFC2822 format dates.</li>

<li>Issues #12169 and #10510: Factor out code used by various packaging commands
to make HTTP POST requests, and make sure it uses CRLF.</li>
<li>Issue #12016: Multibyte CJK decoders now resynchronize faster. They only
ignore the first byte of an invalid byte sequence. For example,
b'xffn'.decode('gb2312', 'replace') gives 'ufffdn' instead of 'ufffd'.</li>
<li>Issue #12459: time.sleep() now raises a ValueError if the sleep length is
negative, instead of an infinite sleep on Windows or raising an IOError on
Linux for example, to have the same behaviour on all platforms.</li>
<li>Issue #12451: pydoc: html_getfile() now uses tokenize.open() to support
Python scripts using a encoding different than UTF-8 (read the coding cookie
of the script).</li>
<li>Issue #12493: subprocess: Popen.communicate() now also handles EINTR errors
if the process has only one pipe.</li>
<li>Issue #12467: warnings: fix a race condition if a warning is emitted at
shutdown, if globals()['__file__'] is None.</li>
<li>Issue #12451: pydoc: importfile() now opens the Python script in binary mode,
instead of text mode using the locale encoding, to avoid encoding issues.</li>
<li>Issue #12451: runpy: run_path() now opens the Python script in binary mode,
instead of text mode using the locale encoding, to support other encodings

disk space statistics.</li>
<li>Issue #12451: The XInclude default loader of xml.etree now decodes files from

to avoid encoding issues.</li>
<li>Issue #12451: doctest.debug_script() doesn't create a temporary file
anymore to avoid encoding issues.</li>
<li>Issue #12451: pydoc.synopsis() now reads the encoding cookie if available,
to read the Python script from the right encoding.</li>
<li>Issue #12451: distutils now opens the setup script in binary mode to read the
encoding cookie, instead of opening it in UTF-8.</li>
<li>Issue #9516: On Mac OS X, change Distutils to no longer globally attempt to
check or set the MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET environment variable for the
interpreter process.  This could cause failures in non-Distutils subprocesses
and was unreliable since tests or user programs could modify the interpreter
environment after Distutils set it.  Instead, have Distutils set the
deployment target only in the environment of each build subprocess.  It is
still possible to globally override the default by setting
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET before launching the interpreter; its value must be
greater or equal to the default value, the value with which the interpreter
was built.  Also, implement the same handling in packaging.</li>

passed to it is a Header object, and Header/make_header no longer fail
if given binary unknown-8bit input.</li>

more quickly. The --multiprocess option is now enabled by default, reducing
the amount of time needed to run the tests. &quot;make test&quot; and &quot;make quicktest&quot;
now include some resource-intensive tests, but no longer run the test suite
twice to check for bugs in .pyc generation. Tools/scripts/run_test.py provides
an easy platform-independent way to run test suite with sensible defaults.</li>

Web site.</li>
<li>Avoid failing in test_urllibnet.test_bad_address when some overzealous
DNS service (e.g. OpenDNS) resolves a non-existent domain name.  The test
is now skipped instead.</li>
<li>Issue #12440: When testing whether some bits in SSLContext.options can be
reset, check the version of the OpenSSL headers Python was compiled against,
rather than the runtime version of the OpenSSL library.</li>

test in a fresh process with only one thread and to not change signal
handling of the parent process.</li>
<li>Issue #8716: Avoid crashes caused by Aqua Tk on OSX when attempting to run
test_tk or test_ttk_guionly under a username that is not currently logged
in to the console windowserver (as may be the case under buildbot or ssh).</li>
<li>Issue #12407: Explicitly skip test_capi.EmbeddingTest under Windows.</li>
<li>Issue #12400: regrtest -W doesn't rerun the tests twice anymore, but captures
the output and displays it on failure instead. regrtest -v doesn't print the
error twice anymore if there is only one error.</li>
<li>Issue #12141: Install copies of template C module file so that
test_build_ext of test_distutils and test_command_build_ext of
test_packaging are no longer silently skipped when
run outside of a build directory.</li>

<li>Issue #11223: Skip test_lock_acquire_interruption() and
test_rlock_acquire_interruption() of test_threadsignals if a thread lock is
